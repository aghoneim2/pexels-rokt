### About Project

```
This is a photo gallery app created as the solution for the take home project defined by Rokt.

This app was created with the Vue 2 JS framework, using a Typescipt Class-Styled approach.

This app consists of 2 main components. The HomeView.vue Componet; this is where the photo gallery is displayed to the user, along with a Search bar for search functionality. This component also includes multiple buttons to trigger a search, clear search results and Paginate between pages of search result.

The ImageView.vue Component is used to display a single image. On hover, an overlay is displayed which shows the Author Name and a link to their Pexels account.

This app utilizes a local backend server in the script.js, located in the root folder. This is a wrapper server in order to not expose the API_KEY to the client.

This project was developed by Ahmed Ghoneim
